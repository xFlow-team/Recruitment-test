# .NET Coding Challenge

Your task is to build an .NET MVC Todo application that allows users to create, read, complete, and delete todo items.
This project contains three different projects and is ready for you to develop an awesome todo application.

There is no strict time limit, and you won't be judged on how long it took you to complete, however we would like you to spend between 2-4 hours on this.

* You must use .NET Core and C# with MVC. Make sure to show off your skills and knowledge of the framework.
* You can you request endpoints both via JavaScript and ASP.NET forms. (Take the opportunity to show off your skills and use both if you want to)
* You do not need to consider any security implications. This includes using HTTPS or attempting to provide any Authorization/Authentication
* You do not need any persistent storage.
* You can use any NuGet package but be prepared to justify its usage.

## Specification

1. Implement an in memory storage for the todo items.
2. Implement a simple UI that allows users to:
   - Create a new todo item
   - View all todo items
   - Mark a todo item as complete
   - Delete a todo item
3. Spent some time reflecting on the design of the application.
   * What kind of architecture is this application using?
   * Are there any design patterns used?
   * How you would improve the application if you had more time?
